TO DO:
- Fix looks
- Make role choosing in registry only for logged in admins(hide it for users)
- Add better labels for register page
- Maybe add pictures to users?
- 18+ users only
- maybe add block function(cant like or interest them), they cant see your profile
- Add calendar choosing date of birth, which calculates the age in the end
- Make input checks like phonenumbers and stuff
- When trying to /login or /register while logged in (request.remoteuser != null) redirect them
back to main page
- Filter posts by some date, user, sort by likes.
- Static User in data initializer on every login so I dont use requests all the time.
- Maybe choose if post is only for matched
