# Dating App

## Functionality:

My plan is to have many users and when each users registers their profiles are visible to every other user. From there the user have the option to be "interested" in another person, with which the person that the user interested in is put in seperate tab (like a wishlist). Other option is to "like" someone, when the user likes someone on that person's profile in the "liked by" tab are shown all the users that liked them, from there they can like them back or "delete" the offer. When two people like each other they are then "matched" and put in the matched tab. The users matched can see the phone number of each other. My first idea was to be able to message each other, but becausee of the college obligtions I didn't have enough time (for now). The idea is to have the phone number, so the users can call each other or message via their phone, but the problem with this is that if they decide to unmatch, they will still have the numbers and that's bad. Apart from the matching functionalities, I've also added "timeline". On the timeline users can add posts where people can like them. When clicked on the user profile people can also see all of that user's posts and his bio. There are also filters for the posts, to find them by keywords or order them by date or likes. The filters are also available for the users to filter them by name, gender, age, or city.
